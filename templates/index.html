        Officer H called her over to the car and asked, "Don't you think it's kind of early to be drinking?" The complainant
        said she wasn't drinking and the can wasn't open; Officer H disagreed with her.  She informed Officer H that she had
        just paid a $200.00 fine for an open container of beer in March and showed him a copy of the citation.  He laughed,
        stating, "I wrote this and I'm going to write you another f**king one." The complainant maintains Officer H incorrectly
        wrote the can size on the citation as being 16 ounces instead of 24 ounces.<br></span>

                In 2017, Philadelphia began publishing police complaint data (dating back until 2013) online. While complaint data is redacted to hide involved officers’ identities, the records do provide information on the demographics of the officer and complainant, the context of the complaint, and the status of the case. (<span class='annotated-text' id="sample-investigation" style="padding: 1px; background-color:rgba(245, 229, 27, 0.5)">Here's a sample complaint investigation.</span>)
                <br><br>
                Over the course of more than seven years represented in the published data, just 16% of investigations have resulted in a sustained finding of any kind and just 2% have resulted in an eventual guilty finding.

                Complaint investigation data from the Philadelphia Police Department classifies
                investigations into three groups: <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(101,141,198,0.6)">Sustained Finding</span>,
                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(242,142,44,0.6)">No Sustained Findings</span>, and

            <div class="title">Disciplinary Outcomes</div>
            <div class="body">
                Among cases where the department's investigation yields a
                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(101,141,198,0.6)">Sustained Finding</span>, the
                complainant(s) must appear at a Police Board of Inquiry hearing, which makes a
                guilty/not guilty recommendation. Their recommendation/report is then sent to the Police Commissioner (or a delegate),
                who is responsible for making a final decision on disciplinary action.
                <br><br>
                The department data classifies these disciplinary outcomes into four groups:
                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(115,152,203,0.6)">Guilty Finding</span>,

                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(178,198,226,0.6)">No Guilty Findings</span>, and
                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(162,162,162,0.6)">Discipline Pending</span>.

                <span class="annotated-text" style="padding: 1px; background-color: rgba(115,152,203,0.6)">Guilty Findings</span>
                include all sustained investigations resulting in an officer being reprimanded, terminated, suspended, or facing criminal charges.
                The data provided by the police department makes no distinction between these outcomes. There is no way to know for certain
                how many cases result in more serious action, except that it is at most equal to the number of guilty findings,
                which account for just 2% of investigation outcomes.
                <br><br>
                Guilty rates also change significantly depending on who is making the complaint. Even when accounting for
                the type of complaint made, the race of the complainant and the officer have a significant impact on the rate of guilty outcomes.

                Just 0.6% of investigations against <span class="annotated-text category-text white">white</span> officers filed by

                Here, the chart has been sorted by complainant race. Recall that a complainant being Black was the second

                the officer was white). You can observe those discrepancies here, as well as looking for patterns in other

                        Protests across the country have led to increased demand for police accountability and institutional changes, with a renewed focus on transparency in the civilian complaint process. In New York City, for example, the repeal of Civil Rights Law § 50a has led to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers" target="_blank">the release</a> of publicly-available (though incomplete) complaint outcome data. This police complaint data gives insight into a key mechanism of accountability, but remains unavailable in all but a handful of American cities.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While there is no uniform standard for collecting police complaints, the complaint process often follows a similar procedure across cities. Following an incident, a civilian files a complaint, either directly with the department or with a civilian oversight agency. After an investigation, a complaint is determined to either be “sustained”, meaning the investigator believes there is sufficient evidence to back up the complaint, or “not sustained” meaning that the investigator does not believe there is sufficient evidence and the investigation is dropped. In the case of sustained complaints, an oversight agency--whether made up of civilians or within the police department--will make a disciplinary decision, ranging from exonerating the officer of wrongdoing, to a suspension, to termination or criminal charges.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Investigative and disciplinary decisions in response to complaints are often made behind closed doors and the process is not always clear. The rates of sustained findings can range across cities <a href="http://data.huffingtonpost.com/2015/12/chicago-officer-misconduct-allegations">from around 6% to 20%</a>. Some <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ad38b1e4b0185f0285195f/t/5b7ecbda1ae6cf17cbe248a8/1535036379266/TerrillIngramPQ+Civilian+Oversight+Study.pdf">evidence</a> exists that investigations involving a civilian board are more likely to result in sustained findings, while the demographics of the complainant and officer likely affect finding rates as well.

                Philadelphia provides more publicly accessible data on police complaints than <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/">almost any other major U.S. city</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since data was first published online in 2017, the rate of investigations resulting in sustained findings
                has gone up more than 60% (you can verify for yourself above), yet in the majority of these cases, disciplinary
                action has remained pending for months or years, and officers attached to multiple complaints remain on the job.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Public data is a first step in holding police departments accountable, but it is not enough. Philadelphia
                has more data available than other cities, but complaint summaries are redacted, disciplinary outcomes remain vague,
                and anonymized IDs replace the names of officers with more than a dozen recorded complaints. In order
                to hold institutions accountable, data must also be transparent.

                    All complaint and disciplinary data since 2015 came from the <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints">City of Philadelphia Open Data Portal</a>. Pre-2015
                    data came from Philly Declaration's <a href="https://github.com/PhillyDeclaration/Philadelphia-Police-Accountability-Project">Police Accountability Project</a>. Note that some investigations/complaints
                    present in the original dataset were excluded from the visualizations if they lacked information on outcomes or involved officers. Fay Walker used U.S. Census Bureau
                    data to approximate police district median income, population, and demographics by combining census tracts.
